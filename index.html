        <h3 id="aboutus">About Us</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1992 near the dawn of the Internet, technology pioneers Oliver Diamond and Jimmy McShane quickly deciphered the need for a social media app centered around music, years before social media applications became commonplace throughout the world. While many music apps have come and gone throughout the decades, IMSb has had staying power, and this year will celebrate its 30th anniversary on the web.</p>
